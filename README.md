# LSTMs_Techniques_for_Sales_Forecasting
## AIM: 
We will discuss how time series modeling and forecasting can be done using LSTM techniques.
## Introduction:
Time series forecasting is one of the major building blocks of Machine Learning. There are many methods in the literature to achieve this like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA), Vector Autoregression (VAR), and so on.
In this task, we will focus on Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) method, which is quite popular if you want to use Deep Learning. We will use Keras in our project to implement LSTM.
## Implementation Step:
The modelling procedure
  1. Importing libraries
  2. Data conversion
  3. Model fitting 
  4. Loading data
  5. Models evaluation

## Install some packages on which our dependency

        pip install matplotlib
        pip install keras
        pip install pandas
## To Run Code 
        Here, I'm using Jupyter Notebook to write code so you can run code to select cell from above to down.
